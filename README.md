<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The original project, found under .mapanimation.js, showed a marker moving along the stops of a bus route between MIT and Harvard. I updated the code (.mapanimation - Modified.js) to move along the stops of Bus 28 from Boston Latin Academy (my alma mater) to the vicinty of my childhood home. I also changed the center location and the marker's initial location (from MIT to BLA). Additionally, I modified the style of the button (i.e. rounded edges, background color, text color).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To get this exercise to work, simply load the HTML file onto your browser. You'll see the map load along with the initial marker. Press the button "Show stops between BLA and Home" and you'll see the marker move along the bus stops. The foundation for this exercise is similar to that used in live bus tracker applications.
