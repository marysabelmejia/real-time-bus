<h1> Real Time Bus Tracker</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Description:</b> The original project found under mapanimation.js showed a marker moving along the stops of a bus route between MIT and Harvard. I updated the code (mapanimation - Modified.js) to move along the stops of Bus 28 from Boston Latin Academy (my alma mater) to the vicinty of my childhood home. I also changed the center location and the marker's initial location (from MIT to BLA). Additionally, I modified the style of the button (i.e. rounded edges, background color, text color).</li>
  <li><b>How to Run:</b> Simply load the html file onto your browser. You'll see the map load along with the marker. Press the button and you'll see the marker move along the bus stops. </li>
  <li><b>Roadmap of Future Improvements:</b> It would be helpful for the name of each stop to appear as the marker moved along. This would aid the user in knowing where the stops are. It might also be helpful if a new marker was created for each stop instead of disappearing onto the next point. </li>
  <li><b>License Information:</b> This should include information about the MIT license.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

Simply load the html file onto your browser. You'll see the map load along with the marker. Press the button and you'll see the marker move along the bus stops.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Add Changelog
- [ ] Add back to top links
- [ ] Add Additional Templates w/ Examples
- [ ] Add "components" document to easily copy & paste sections of the readme

It would be helpful for the name of each stop to appear as the marker moved along. This would aid the user in knowing where the stops are. It might also be helpful if a new marker was created for each stop instead of disappearing onto the next point.
