<h1> Real Time Bus Tracker</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Description:</b> The original project found under mapanimation.js showed a marker moving along the stops of a bus route between MIT and Harvard. I updated the code (mapanimation - Modified.js) to move along the stops of Bus 28 from Boston Latin Academy (my alma mater) to the vicinty of my childhood home. I also changed the center location and the marker's initial location (from MIT to BLA). Additionally, I modified the style of the button (i.e. rounded edges, background color, text color).</li>
  <li><b>How to Run:</b> Simply load the html file onto your browser. You'll see the map load along with the marker. Press the button and you'll see the marker move along the bus stops. </li>
  <li><b>Roadmap of Future Improvements:</b> It would be helpful for the name of each stop to appear as the marker moved along. This would aid the user in knowing where the stops are. It might also be helpful if a new marker was created for each stop instead of disappearing onto the next point. </li>
  <li><b>License Information:</b> This should include information about the MIT license.</li>
</ul>
